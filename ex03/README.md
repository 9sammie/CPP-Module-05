# CPP-Module-05

This project is part of the C++ modules at 42 and focuses on repetition and exception handling.

Through a bureaucrat theme, the exercises adress the creation of robust classes with constant attributes and business constraints, the throwing and handling of costum exceptions, relationships between classes, and a clear separation of responsabilities between objects.

Thsse exercises evolve progressivly to understand some concepts:

-ex_00: create the Buraucrat class and introduction to exceptions.
-ex_01: Buraucrat and Form interaction.
-ex_02: Form become AForm to implement concrete forms.
-ex_03: factorisation of the forms through the Intern class.
